In the heart of Bundelkhand, where aspirations often succumbed to the weight of remoteness, Swarnil emerged as a beacon of hope. Hailing from a humble background, his father believed in the power of education to transcend boundaries. Swarnil, fueled by dreams of becoming an IITian or NITian, found himself at a crossroads in the 12th grade.

With a determination that eclipsed the challenges of his remote upbringing, Swarnil embarked on a journey to pursue higher education. His father, recognizing the potential within his son, decided to send him away for a better chance at a good education.

As Swarnil navigated through the unfamiliar corridors of Kota, dreams of IIT and NIT fueled his late-night study sessions. The odds, however, seemed stacked against him, and Kota's competitive atmosphere proved to be a formidable adversary. Despite relentless efforts, the coveted success remained elusive.

Undeterred, Swarnil pivoted toward a more achievable goalâ€”a reputable government college that would alleviate the financial burden on his family. Joining AIEEE classes, he strived to secure a seat in the best government engineering college in Madhya Pradesh.

The journey wasn't without its share of setbacks. The dream of IIT/NIT faded, but a new chapter began as Swarnil secured admission into the Computer Science stream at one of MP's best private colleges, LNCT Bhopal.

The transition from a remote corner of Bundelkhand to the bustling city of Bhopal marked the beginning of Swarnil's metamorphosis into a software engineer. The financial constraints that once loomed large were replaced by the promise of a bright future.

As he delved into the world of computer science, Swarnil discovered his passion for coding and problem-solving. LNCT Bhopal became the canvas where he painted the strokes of his dreams, transforming setbacks into stepping stones.

Through dedication and resilience, Swarnil's journey echoed a narrative of triumph over adversity. From a student who once yearned for the hallowed halls of IIT to a budding software engineer sculpting his path in LNCT Bhopal, Swarnil's story embodied the essence of unwavering determination and the transformative power of education.

## Markdown output ðŸ›«

[CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/) can be configured to output Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting to plain text documents. Use the **Source** button to check and edit the Markdown source code of this content.

The editor-produced Markdown output supports most essential features, like [links](https://ckeditor.com/), **different** kinds of _emphasis_, `inline code formatting`, or code blocks:

```css
p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
```

<div id="test-target" class="uk-height-large uk-background-cover uk-light uk-flex" uk-parallax="bgy: -200" style="background-image: url('https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/8d/02/bc8d026b258afad9a3d4b1b84ed6721f.gif');">
  
    <div class="uk-text-center uk-margin-auto uk-margin-auto-vertical" uk-parallax="target: #test-target; y: 100,0"> {% include ad.html type="small-leaderboard" %}
    </div> 

</div>

## Markdown input ðŸ›¬

Thanks to the [autoformatting feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/autoformat.html), you can use Markdown syntax when writing. Try it out - use these (or any other) Markdown shortcuts in the editor to format the content on the fly ðŸš€!

| Inline formatting | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| **Bold** | Type `**` or `__` around your text. |
| _Italic_ | Type `*` or `_` around your text. |
| `Code` | Type `Ë‹` around your text. |
| ~Strikethrough~ | Type `~~` around your text. |

Shh! ðŸ¤« Markdown has very basic support for tables. Some advanced table-related features like table or cell styling were disabled in this demo.

## Block formatting

You can also use Markdown to create various text blocks, such as:

*   Block quotes - Start a line with `ï¹¥` followed by a space.
*   Headings:
    1.  Heading 1 - Start a line with `#` followed by a space.
    2.  Heading 2 - Start a line with `##` followed by a space.
    3.  Heading 3 - Start a line with `###` followed by a space.
*   Lists, including nested ones:
    *   Numbered lists - Start a line with `1.` or `1)` followed by a space.
    *   Bulleted lists - Start a line with `*` or `-` followed by a space.
    *   To-do lists - Start a line with `[ ]` or `[x]` followed by a space to insert an unchecked or checked list item.
*   Code blocks - Start a line with `Ë‹Ë‹Ë‹`.
*   Horizontal lines - Start a line with `---`
